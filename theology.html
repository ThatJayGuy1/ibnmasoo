                    <h2>The Pleasure of Paradise</h2>
                    <p class="author">By Sheikh Muhammad Lugoloobi</p>
                </div>
                
                <p>The reality of Paradise is something which people will never be able to understand until they actually enter it, but God has shown us glimpses of it in the Quran. He has described it as a place essentially different to the life of this world, both in the very nature and purpose of life, as well as the types of delights which people will enjoy therein.</p>
                
                <h3>Pure delight without pain and suffering</h3>
                <p>While people in this world experience some delight, they also face much toil and suffering. As for the life of the Hereafter, there will be neither hardship nor suffering in it, and people will live therein in pure joy and delight. All the causes of sorrow, pain and suffering which people experience in this life will be absent in the Hereafter.</p>
                
                <h3>Wealth</h3>
                <p>God has promised the inhabitants of Paradise that they will have all that they imagined as far as wealth and belongings are concerned. God gives us a glimpse of this when He says:</p>
                
                <div class="quote arabic">
                    "... هناك كل ما تشتهيه الأنفس وتلذ الأعين ..."
                </div>
                <div class="translation">
                    "... there will be there all that the souls could desire, all that the eyes could delight in ..." (Quran 43:71)
                </div>
                
                <h3>Disease and Death</h3>
                <p>Another cause of pain and suffering in this life is the death of a loved one or disease, which are both non-existent in Paradise. None will feel any sickness or pain in Paradise. The Prophet Muhammad said about the people of Paradise:</p>
                <div class="quote">
                    "They will never fall ill, blow their noses or spit."
                </div>
                
                <h3>Social Relationships</h3>
                <p>As for the remorse felt due to a rift in personal relationships, people will never hear any evil or hurting comments or speech in Paradise. They will only hear good words and words of peace. God says:</p>
                <div class="quote arabic">
                    "لا يسمعون فيها لغوا ولا تأثيما إلا قيلا سلاما سلاما"
                </div>
                <div class="translation">
                    "They will not hear therein ill speech or commission of sin. But only the saying of: Peace! Peace!" (Quran 56:25-26)

                    <h2>Six Articles of Faith</h2>
                    <p class="author">By Sheikh Uthman Kayongo</p>
                </div>
                
                <p>Muslim doctrine is often summarized in "Six Articles of Faith." These are the fundamental beliefs which every Muslim must ascribe to:</p>
                
                <h3>1. One God (Allah)</h3>
                <p>The central belief in Islam is that there is one God. The Muslim name for God is "Allah," which is Arabic for "the (al) God (Ilah)."</p>
                
                <h3>2. The angels of God</h3>
                <p>Angels in Islam are spiritual creatures that serve the purposes of Allah. They are messengers who relay communication to people and carry out other responsibilities.</p>
                
                <h3>3. The books of God, especially the Qur'an</h3>
                <p>The Quran is the most important writing in Islam and is the highest authority in both religious and legal matters. Muslims believe the Quran to be an errorless record of the angel Gabriel's revelations to Muhammad.</p>
                
                <h3>4. The prophets of God, especially Muhammad</h3>
                <p>Muhammad is the most important historical and theological figure in Islam. His name, which means "highly praised," reflects this.</p>
                
                <h3>5. The Day of Judgment (or the afterlife)</h3>
                <p>Muslims believe in the continued existence of the soul and a transformed physical existence after death. Islam teaches that there will be a day of judgment when all humans will be divided between the eternal destinations of Paradise and Hell.</p>
                
                <h3>6. The supremacy of God's will (or predestination)</h3>
                <p>Islam teaches that God not only foreknows, but also foreordains all that comes to pass in the world and in the lives of individuals.</p>
